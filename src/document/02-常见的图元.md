### TubeBufferGeometry, TubeGeometry

return new THREE.TubeBufferGeometry(path, tubularSegments, radius, radialSegments, closed);
```

### EdgesGeometry
A helper object that takes another geometry as input and generates edges only if the angle between faces is greater than some threshold. For example if you look at the box at the top it shows a line going through each face showing every triangle that makes the box. Using an EdgesGeometry instead the middle lines are removed.

```JS
removed.
const width = 8;
const height = 8;
const depth = 8;
return {
  lineGeometry: new THREE.EdgesGeometry(new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry(width, height, depth)),
};
```

### WireframeGeometry
Generates geometry that contains one line segment (2 points) per edge in the given geometry. Without this you'd often be missing edges or get extra edges since WebGL generally requires 2 points per line segment. For example if all you had was a single triangle there would only be 3 points. If you tried to draw it using a material with wireframe: true you would only get a single line. Passing that triangle geometry to a WireframeGeometry will generate a new geometry that has 3 lines segments using 6 points.

```JS
const width = 8;
const height = 8;
const depth = 8;
return {
  lineGeometry: new THREE.WireframeGeometry(new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry(width, height, depth)),
};
```
